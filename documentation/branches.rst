timing_measurement: Branch to measure the timing of the loops based on bit flipping of a few pins on the AQ board, using hardware interrupts on another board to count the frequency.

aq_makefile : Branch to copy in the makefile from the old drone repository. No other changes so merging with other branches is simple
